# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Changes Accepted

Please file issues before doing substantial work; this will ensure that others
don't duplicate the work and that there's a chance to discuss any design issues.

Changes only tweaking style are unlikely to be accepted unless they are applied
consistently across the project. Most of the code style is derived from the
[Google Style Guides](http://google.github.io/styleguide/) for the appropriate
language and is generally not something we accept changes on (as clang-format
and clang-tidy handle that for us). The compiler portion of the project follows
[MLIR style](https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/DeveloperGuide/#style-guide).
Improvements to code structure and clarity are welcome but please file issues to
track such work first.

## AUTHORS file

If you would like to receive additional recognition for your contribution, you
may add yourself (or your organization) to the AUTHORS file. This keeps track of
those who have made significant contributions to the project. Please add the
entity who owns the copyright for your contribution. The source control history
remains the most accurate source for individual contributions.

##  Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
